## Projects

### COVID-19 Data Analysis

A partner and I created an ETL package for data on the COVID-19 pandemic, created a database to hold that data, analyzed said data and created a Power-BI dashboard to show our findings and allow the user to drill down into the pandemic. We chose to focus on the US and allow the user to drill down to the county level.

### Database projects

A few projects working with SQL creating databases and managing them. I created many advanced queries and developed my skills with database programming.
